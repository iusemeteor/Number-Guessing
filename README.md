# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game I made in Python. The program randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player attempts to guess the number. The game provides feedback whether the guess should be higher or lower and tracks the number of attempts.

## Features

- Randomly selects a number between a specified range.
- Provides feedback to guess higher or lower.
- Tracks the number of attempts.
- Cheat mode to reveal the number.

## Configuration

- **HIGHEST_NUMBER**: The highest number in the range. Default is 100.
- **LOWEST_NUMBER**: The lowest number in the range. Default is 1.
- **VERSION**: The version of the game. Default is "v2.0.0".
- **AUTHOR**: The author of the game. Default is "meteor".
- **CHEAT**: If set to `True`, the game will display the random number at the start. Default is `False`.
